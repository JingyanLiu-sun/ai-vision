Industrial Revolution and economic development in late 19th century improved living conditions in most countries, accelerating population growth. From mid-20th century, developing countries like China and India had extremely rapid population growth. After entering 20th century, high-income countries' population growth rate gradually slowed down."

Compared to industrialized countries, income levels in countries like India, China, some African countries didn't change much for most of 19th century. Rapid development of emerging economies like China, India in late 20th and early 21st centuries gradually caught up with high-income countries. Despite overall global income growth in late 20th century, income gap between high-income and low-income countries still exists. Global income changes experienced huge unbalanced development, early dominated by developed countries' income growth driven by Industrial Revolution, later emerging economies' rise brought transformation of income pattern, but global income gap remains significant."

Taking Guangdong as example, its GDP grew from 1,865.83 billion yuan in 2004 to 13,567.32 billion yuan in 2023, about 6.3 times growth. By comparing growth rates in different periods, can find economic growth rate overall shows slowing trend. For example, Guangdong's average annual growth rate was about 14.4% during 2004-2013, slowed to about 8.0% during 2014-2023. This shows China's economy is transitioning from high-speed growth to high-quality development stage. Beijing and Shanghai as municipalities have relatively high total GDP, possibly reflecting their status as financial, technology and service centers. Even when facing global economic challenges (like 2020), most regions maintained positive growth, demonstrating resilience of China's economy."

Overall, eastern coastal developed regions (like Beijing, Guangdong, Shanghai) have relatively significant population growth, average increase between 1.5%-2%. These regions attract large floating population, rich economic development and employment opportunities are main reasons. Conversely, northeast regions (like Heilongjiang, Jilin) have negative population growth, Heilongjiang has most severe population decline, decreased 1.15%. These regions face dual pressures of industrial decline and population outflow. In addition, some central and western provinces (like Guizhou, Gansu) also have slowing population growth. Future population change focus may concentrate on relationship between urbanization advancement and widening regional economic development gap, eastern economic centers may continue to attract population, while provinces with single economic structure will face population loss challenges."

Despite this, most provinces show continuous growth trend during 2004-2023, reflecting overall development of China's economy. However, recent years' growth rate generally slowed down, possibly reflecting impact of economic transformation and structural adjustment. Notably, some provinces like Guizhou, Tibet have relatively fast fiscal revenue growth, may be closely related to national regional development strategies and support policies. Meanwhile, provinces with diversified economic structure like Guangdong and Zhejiang show stronger resilience when facing economic fluctuations, highlighting importance of industrial diversity for fiscal stability."

Birth rate has obvious regional differences, Tibet's birth rate has remained at relatively high level, compared to big cities like Shanghai, Beijing with lower birth rates, 3.95‰ and 5.63‰ respectively in 2023. Although two-child policy restrictions were lifted in middle period, data shows birth rate didn't significantly increase, instead continued to decline in following years.

Big cities like Beijing and Shanghai have lower birth rates, possibly related to urbanization, living costs and lifestyle changes. Tibet has higher birth rate, reflecting cultural and policy influences. Although comprehensive two-child policy was implemented in 2016, data shows birth rate didn't significantly increase, instead continued to decline in following years, showing limited policy impact. Economically developed provinces like Guangdong, Zhejiang have relatively low birth rates, possibly due to increased living pressure and parenting costs.",
